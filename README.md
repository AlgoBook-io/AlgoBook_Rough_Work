Link for the live applicatiion: https://algobook-io.github.io/Searching-Sorting-Visualizer/

The application is aimed to help better understand searching and various sorting and algorithms by visualizing the steps and realizing how the algorithm actually works. The data is randomly generated and can be change by the click of a button. The number of data items and the speed(inverse of the transition delay) is left for the user to choose according to his/her convenience. There are also options to skip the remaining animations. The application is still under development and new algorithms will be added soon.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
